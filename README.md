# ATHcrowdmeter


## STAR Method 



## Situation:
For UGA Hacks 8 we wanted to create a website that would tell you how crowded a resturaunt is in Athens depending on the time. We had 36 hours to do this project, and ultimately created a final project that we are extremly proud of. The fact that this project was cultivated in such a short time truly demonstrates how strong our work ethic was as a team. 




## Task:
For UGA Hacks 8 we were tasked with creating any project that related to the theme, which was travel. We were given 36 hours, so my team opted to create a website that served our local community. The ultimate goal of our project was to aid local buisnesses, and increase local consumerism. We really just wanted to make it so that it was easier to choose a resturaunt. Typically when you want to see what is good to eat in the area you google "best resturaunts near me", and then you might check out the google meter that tells you if its busy or not. We wanted to make this easier for the user and decided to put everything all in one place. So our website contains the top resturaunts in Athens, as well as their ratings, addresses, and their level of crowdedness.


## Action: 
For this project we had to research the top resturaunts in Athens frequented by students. So the majority of our resturaunts are within 5 miles of the UGA campus. We also had to gather all the important information about the resturaunts in an excel spreadsheet. We then had to code a website using HTML and Java Script. Specifically one of the harder issues we had was creating the crowd meter. At first we opted utlize an API that had access to information about population at resturaunts, but we realized we did not have enough expereience or time to do that. So then we opted to use a JS package called AnyChart. Which allowed us to hardcode the resturaunt crowd meter based on information found on Google. We then opted to locally host the website utlizing Docker, this was the best choice as we expect only moderate web traffic.


## Result:
We ultimately created a website that allowed UGA students/ residents of downtown Athens to be able to find popular local resturaunts, that allows people to see how crowded it is as well.
